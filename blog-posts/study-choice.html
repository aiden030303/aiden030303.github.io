      <h1 class="blog-post-header">My HBO-ICT Choice</h1>
      <h2>September 5th 2025</h2>
      <article>
        <p class="filler-text">
          I chose the HBO-ICT program at HZ University of Applied Sciences
          because it aligns with my passion for technology. Since I was young,
          I’ve been fascinated by computers, from building my own to exploring
          how websites and software work. The joy of solving problems through
          coding drives me veen though ive just started two weeks ago. Below, I
          share my journey to choosing this program, why it motivates me, and my
          goals after graduation.
        </p>

        <h2>Study Choice Activities</h2>
        <p class="filler-text">
          I explored my study options through practical steps. I attended an HZ
          open day in 2024 to learn about the HBO-ICT program. I also researched
          online, visiting hz.nl to get fimiliar with the curriculum and tracks
          like Software Engineering and Data Science. These activities confirmed
          HBO-ICT as my top choice.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation for HBO-ICT</h2>
        <p class="filler-text">
          Computers have always excited me. Problem-solving is my favorite
          part—tackling a coding issue, over the past 2 weeks finding a solution
          to a problem ive been frustrated with for ages feels rewarding.
          HBO-ICT suits me because it emphasizes practical skills, like
          developing apps or designing systems. With two parents who both worked
          in IT, computer science seemed like the natural descision for me, but
          after the past two weeks im sure i made the right descision.
        </p>

        <h2>After Completing the Study</h2>
        <p class="filler-text">
          After graduating, I would like to start my own company in software
          developemnt or cyber security. Both these profressions appeal to me
          because they seem fun and comfortable. I want to build user-friendly
          websites or protect systems from threats. The ICT field offers diverse
          roles in wich im sure i'll find something that suits me.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="filler-text">
          Choosing HBO-ICT at HZ was a natural decision. My love for technology
          and problem-solving fits the program’s practical approach. I’m excited
          to grow my skills and build a career in ICT.
