      <h2>September 5th 2025</h2>
      <article>
        <p class="filler-text">
          I’m Aiden Jans, a first-year HBO-ICT student at HZ University of
          Applied Sciences. My programming journey is just beginning, but it’s
          already exciting. Three weeks before starting school, I switched from
          Windows to Arch Linux, sparking my interest in coding. This post
          shares my early programming experiences, from self-learning to my
          first projects at HZ, and how they fuel my passion for technology.
        </p>

        <h2>First Steps in Coding Before joining HZ</h2>
        <p>
          Before joining HZ, I had little coding experience. In August 2025, I
          installed Arch Linux on my computer, a process that taught me about
          systems and command-line basics. But other then that i don't have any
          experience with computer science.
        </p>

        <h2>Building Skills at HZ</h2>
        <p>
          At HZ, I’m building on that foundation. My first programming course
          introduced me to HTML and CSS, skills I used to create this website. I
          worked on a simple webpage project. The HBO-ICT program’s hands-on
          approach so far, the lessons and assignments at HZ suit my learning
          style. I enjoy troubleshooting errors, as it feels like solving a
          puzzle.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Goals in Programming</h2>
        <p>
          My programming experience is still growing, but I’m eager to learn
          more. I want to start on learning languages like Python, C, C#, C++
          and explore JavaScript for web development. The ICT field excites me
          because it’s full of challenges, like debugging code or building
          user-friendly sites. The fun i get from coding and aspiration keeps me
          motivated.
