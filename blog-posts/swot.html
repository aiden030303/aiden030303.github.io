          <h2>September 5th 2025</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="filler-text">I’m Aiden Jans, a first-year HBO-ICT student at HZ University of Applied Sciences. Understanding my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats helps me grow in the ICT field. This post shares my SWOT analysis, based on my SKC document, to show how I navigate my studies and plan for a career in software development or cybersecurity.</p>

            <h2>My Strengths</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">My curiosity drives me to explore how systems work, like when I set up Arch Linux. I focus well on tasks, which helps me tackle coding problems, such as debugging a webpage layout. My dedication to learning new skills, like HTML and CSS at HZ, supports my progress. These strengths make me a good fit for HBO-ICT’s hands-on teaching style.</p>

            <h2>My Weaknesses</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">I sometimes struggle with time management, especially when balancing studies and hobbies like gaming. My practically non-existent programming experience. Recognizing these gaps pushes me to plan better and seek help from HZ’s supportive lecturers, ensuring I improve steadily.</p>
            
            <h2>Opportunities in ICT</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">The ICT field offers many possibilities. With 92% of HZ graduates employed within three months, I see paths in software development and cybersecurity. HZ’s practical courses, like building websites, let me develop skills employers value. Networking at events like the IT conference in Utrecht, can connect me with industry professionals.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Overcome</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">Competition in ICT is high, as many students pursue similar roles. My lack of experience could make early projects challenging. To address this, I focus on HZ’s assignments and online tutorials to build my skills. Staying updated on tech trends.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">My SWOT analysis guides my HBO-ICT journey. My strengths fuel my passion, while my weaknesses show where to improve. Opportunities at HZ and in ICT motivate me, and I’m ready to tackle threats with hard work. This reflection shapes my path toward a tech career.</p>
