          <h2>September 5th 2025</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="filler-text">I’m Aiden Jans, a first-year HBO-ICT student at HZ University of Applied Sciences. My first SKC assignment gave me valuable feedback to improve my work. This post reflects on the feedback I received, how it highlighted my strengths and weaknesses, and my thoughts on using it to grow in the HBO-ICT program.</p>

            <h2>Feedback on Aesthetics</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">The feedback praised the aesthetics of my SKC assignment. My webpage design, built with HTML and CSS, looked clean and user-friendly. The layout was clear, with a dark theme that matched my website’s style. This positive note boosted my confidence, as I enjoy creating visually appealing projects, like the simple webpage I made in my first programming course at the HZ.</p>

            <h2>Feedback on Variable Naming</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">The feedback noted that my variable names were questionable. Names like "red" or "blue" were too specific wich would make changing theme/ color a hassle. This critique was fair, as my limited programming experience, led to amateuristic choices. Clear variable names, like "color1" or "clr-button-hover", improve code versatility, a skill I need for computer science.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">The feedback showed me where to improve. I learned that aesthetics matter, but clear code is just as important. I now focus on naming variables descriptively to make my work easier to understand and more versatily.</p>

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p class="filler-text">The SKC feedback motivates me to refine my coding habits. I plan to use better variable names in future projects, like my next HTML assignment. I also aim to seek lecturer guidance to strengthen my skills.</p>
